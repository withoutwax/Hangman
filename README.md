# Hangman Game
This is a simple hangman game where you can play.

This game is originally created to teach some students to learn English vocabulary.

### Things to do:
 - [ ] Aesthetics & Design - Need to add color & make the game beautiful.
 - [ ] Restart system - After you WIN or LOSE the game, need to restart to the original screen.
 - [ ] Win or lose rate (in percentage). This would probably need an profile / account system.

### Ideas:
 - [ ] Input system - User might use this app as a study device (which is actually the original motivation for this game).
 - [ ] Server / Database for the Hangman game to store vocabularies and definitions of the words.
 - [ ] Profile / Account system - Now it's more like a flashcard app, in a Hangman game.
